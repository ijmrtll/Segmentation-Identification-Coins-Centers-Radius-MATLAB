Open Matlab and change the working directory to the one containing the project (Figueroa_Part2_Final) open the file exploration2.m in the editor and run in from there.

The code was made with the intention to be a little bit interactive in order to analyze the images faster without having to change lines of code.

!!When you run the script it will clear the command window and it will clear the workspace!! you can disable this by commenting the two lines following: 
%clear at the beginning

One you run the script, look at the command window for the question:
Which image set would you like to work with? [1...4]:
Here you will select with which set of images you would like to work

then look at the command window for the question:
Which test image would you like to analyze? [1...6]:

Here you can select what image you want to star working with (it can be changed latter)

From here follow the instructions in the different menus and look at the corresponding figure, each analysis have its own figure. To cancel most of the operations you can use the number 0 in the menus, to cancel or to stop the script in the main menu.

Example:
To perform a Hough Transformation to find the circles of the BW version of the image #3 in the set #1 you will have to follow the following inputs when prompted:

1, 3, 11, 8, 1, n, 76, 107, n
